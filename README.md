A self-using enviroment with docker support, for development and vulnerability analyze.

[vulhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) is docker based project for speed up enviroment creation. Is useful for vulnerability analyze and replay. 
This repository was craeted because I'm lazy to pull request a new enviroment to `vulhub` and the most enviroment of `vulhub` has no detail on how they build the image, I know it's not the key point of that project but it's good for modifer and learning.
